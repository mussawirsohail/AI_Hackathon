# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Hands-On Learning First
Every concept is accompanied by practical, hands-on exercises; Code examples must be executable and well-documented; All projects should incrementally build on previous concepts

### Beginner to Intermediate Progression
Content must be accessible to beginners without overwhelming complexity; Advanced topics should build logically from fundamentals; Clear learning paths for different skill levels

### Practical Application Focus (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Theory must always be connected to real-world implementation; Each chapter requires a practical example or project; Reader should be able to build functional prototypes after each section

### Accessible Documentation
All documentation must use Docusaurus for consistent, searchable format; Code examples should be copy-paste runnable; Visual aids and diagrams are mandatory for complex concepts

### Physical AI Integration
Content must demonstrate how AI algorithms interface with physical systems; Emphasis on sensor integration, motor control, and real-time processing; Safety and ethical considerations in robotics implementation

### Modular Development Approach
Systems should be built in modular components for easy learning and reuse; Clear interfaces between different robot subsystems; Encourage experimentation with individual components

## Technology Stack Requirements

Primary documentation platform: Docusaurus with GitHub integration; Recommended programming languages: Python, C++, and ROS (Robot Operating System); Simulation environments: Gazebo, PyBullet, or Webots; Hardware platforms: Any affordable humanoid robot platform (e.g., Poppy, NAO, or custom Arduino/Raspberry Pi builds)

## Development and Learning Workflow

Content must include step-by-step tutorials with expected outcomes; Each chapter should have clear learning objectives and self-assessment questions; Regular practical assignments that build towards a complete humanoid robot project; Peer collaboration encouraged through community forums and shared projects

## Governance
All content must follow the established learning progression from beginner to intermediate; New chapters must connect with previous material; All code examples must be tested on at least one physical or simulated platform; Community feedback must be incorporated through regular review cycles
