# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module introduces you to the Robot Operating System version 2 (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system of a robot, enabling communication between different components and subsystems.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Create and work with ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Understand and work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids

## Module Structure

This module contains four lessons that build upon each other:

1. **Lesson 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 - Understanding the middleware architecture
2. **Lesson 2**: Nodes, Topics, and Services - The communication patterns in ROS 2
3. **Lesson 3**: Bridging Python Agents - Connecting AI agents to ROS controllers
4. **Lesson 4**: Understanding URDF - Describing robot structure and kinematics

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Familiarity with Python or C++
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 8-12 hours

## Next Steps

Begin with Lesson 1 to dive into the fundamentals of ROS 2, the middleware that enables sophisticated robot control and communication.
