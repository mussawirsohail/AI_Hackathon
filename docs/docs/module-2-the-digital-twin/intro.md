# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on digital twin technology, specifically using Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation and environment building. Digital twins enable us to test and validate robot behaviors in a safe, virtual environment before deploying to physical hardware.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure physics simulation environments in Gazebo
- Create realistic environments for humanoid robot testing
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Understand the advantages of simulation in robot development

## Module Structure

This module contains four lessons that build upon each other:

1. **Lesson 1**: Introduction to Gazebo - Setting up simulation environments
2. **Lesson 2**: Physics Simulation - Modeling gravity, collisions, and physical interactions
3. **Lesson 3**: High-Fidelity Rendering - Visual rendering and human-robot interaction
4. **Lesson 4**: Sensor Simulation - Simulating realistic sensor data for perception systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, friction)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts (helpful but not required)

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 10-15 hours

## Next Steps

Begin with Lesson 1 to learn how to set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for humanoid robots.
