# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to your comprehensive guide on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This book covers everything from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations in robotics.

Use the floating AI assistant at the bottom-right corner of the screen to ask questions about any topic in this book. The assistant can answer questions about ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language-Action systems, and more!

## Book Structure

This book is organized into 4 comprehensive modules:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Middleware for robot control, Nodes, Topics, Services, and bridging Python agents to ROS
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation, environment building, and sensor simulation
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Advanced perception, synthetic data generation, and navigation
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Convergence of LLMs and Robotics, voice-to-action, and cognitive planning

## Getting Started

Get started by exploring the modules using the sidebar. For any questions about the content, click on the floating AI assistant icon at the bottom-right of your screen.
