# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This website contains the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, a detailed educational resource covering the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, specifically focusing on creating systems that can interact with the physical world through humanoid forms.

## About This Book

This book is structured into four comprehensive modules, each containing four detailed lessons:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Middleware for robot control, covering ROS 2 fundamentals
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation and environment building
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)** - Advanced perception and training
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - The convergence of LLMs and Robotics

Each lesson emphasizes hands-on learning with practical examples and exercises that allow you to build functional prototypes.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for learners with a beginner to intermediate background who want to understand and implement humanoid robotics systems. We assume basic programming knowledge, ideally in Python or C++, and some familiarity with robotics concepts.

## Local Development

To run this book locally for development or review:

```bash
npm install
npm start
