# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, a comprehensive platform for developing, simulating, and deploying AI-powered robots. We'll cover advanced perception systems, hardware-accelerated computing, and training techniques specifically relevant to humanoid robotics.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac for humanoid robotics applications
- Implement advanced perception systems using Isaac Sim
- Leverage hardware acceleration for VSLAM and navigation
- Apply the Nav2 framework for path planning in humanoid robots

## Module Structure

This module contains four lessons that build upon each other:

1. **Lesson 1**: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac - Overview of the platform and ecosystem
2. **Lesson 2**: Isaac Sim - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
3. **Lesson 3**: Isaac ROS - Hardware-accelerated VSLAM and navigation
4. **Lesson 4**: Nav2 - Path planning for bipedal humanoid movement

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and simulation fundamentals)
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Understanding of basic computer vision and perception concepts
- Familiarity with AI/ML concepts (helpful but not required)

## Duration

Estimated time to complete: 12-18 hours

## Next Steps

Begin with Lesson 1 to get an overview of the NVIDIA Isaac platform and its applications in humanoid robotics.
